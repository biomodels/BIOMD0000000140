This model corresponds to the IkB-NFkB signaling in wild type cells and
reproduces the dynamics of the species as depicted in Figure 2 F of the paper.
The authors mention that the simulation is carried out in three phases, where
the steady state values of the species in one phase are fed to the succeding
phase. This model captures the simulation dynamics of two phases and makes use
of the event section to introduce the stimulus and thereby transition to the
next phase. Accordingly, a few terms have been introduced that make this
transition possible, this in no way compromises the original model. Also, the
simulation plots are not an exact reproduction of the figures in the paper,
they do however match the simulation results that the authors shared with us.
Model was successfully tested on MathSBML.
